# OpenSig

A web app for digitally signing and verifying files on EVM-based blockchains.  

Files are hashed on the local machine and notarised to the blockchain alongside the signer's public address, providing proof of possession as well as proof of existence.  Signatures can optionally include a small amount of public or encrypted data, allowing, for example, the reason for signing to be given or a link to a file on IPFS.  

The app can be found online at https://bubbleprotocol.com/opensig.
