# OpenSig

A web app for digitally signing and verifying files on EVM-based blockchains.  

The app can be found online at https://opensig.net

Files are hashed on the local machine and notarised to the blockchain alongside the signer's public address, providing proof of possession as well as proof of existence.  Signatures can optionally include a small amount of public or encrypted data, allowing, for example, the reason for signing to be given or a link to a file on IPFS.  

See https://opensig.net/about.html for more information.
