<h1>OpenSig Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 22-July-2025</p>

<p>Thank you for using OpenSig. Your privacy and trust are critical to us. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is handled within the OpenSig Android app.</p>

<hr>

<h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> When you register or recover your digital identity, we collect your email address solely to enable account recovery using a one-time passcode (OTP). Your email address is not used for marketing purposes unless you explicitly consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Digital Identity:</strong> When you register we collect your public digital identity (DID) solely to enable account recovery using a one-time passcode (OTP). Your DID is not shared with others or used for any other purpose.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> If you purchase signature top-ups through our app, payments are processed securely by Stripe. OpenSig does not store your credit or debit card information.</li>
    <li><strong>Transaction Data:</strong> OpenSig publishes blockchain signatures to the Polygon blockchain that represent your actions within the app. These signatures do not contain identifiable personal data and cannot be traced back to you without access to the original document.</li>
    <li><strong>Email Communication Preferences:</strong> We record your explicit consent regarding:
        <ol>
            <li>Receiving emails for important app updates.</li>
            <li>Receiving emails for special offers.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>What Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Document Content:</strong> Your documents remain on your device. We do not upload, store, or process the content of your documents on any server.</li>
    <li><strong>Cryptocurrency Wallet Information:</strong> Your ERC-4337 smart wallet is created and managed locally on your device. Your private keys are never transmitted or stored externally by OpenSig.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Securely managing and recovering your OpenSig account.</li>
    <li>Processing your signature purchase transactions.</li>
    <li>Enabling you to verify and notarize signatures through the blockchain.</li>
    <li>Sending email communications based on your explicit preferences for important app updates and special offers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Your Information Is Protected</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Your email and OTP-based recovery information are secured using industry-standard encryption practices.</li>
    <li>Payments are securely processed via Stripe, ensuring your payment details are encrypted and compliant with PCI DSS standards.</li>
    <li>All blockchain interactions maintain your anonymity and privacy, as blockchain signatures alone cannot identify you or your documents without the original files.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third Parties</h2>
<p>We do not share your personal data with third parties other than for payment processing purposes through Stripe, which complies with high-level security standards.</p>

<h2>User Control and Self-Custody</h2>
<p>OpenSig leverages blockchain technology and smart wallets, giving you full control of your digital identity. You can modify or remove modules such as the email recovery feature at any time for full self-custody.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. You will be informed of any significant changes via an app notification or email.</p>
